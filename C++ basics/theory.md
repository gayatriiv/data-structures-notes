makes the program : 1. modular

pass by values :

a copy of the value goes into the function and changes are not reflected in the main. 

pass by reference:

the orginal value goes into the function and changes accordingly.
we use "&" to denote it to the memory address so that original value is taken . (for eg: (string &s))

arrays are specifically passed as a reference.
